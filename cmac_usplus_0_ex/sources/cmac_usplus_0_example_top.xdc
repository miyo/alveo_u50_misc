### Transceiver Reference Clock Placement
### Transceivers should be adjacent to allow timing constraints to be met easily.
### Full details of available transceiver locations can be found in the appropriate
### Transceiver User Guide, or use the Transceiver Wizard.

### These are sample constraints, please use correct constraints for your device
### As per GT recommendation, gt_ref_clk should be connected to the middle quad for GTH/GTY config


### Incase of VCU118-REV-2.0 board with xcvu9p-flga2104-2L-e device,
### if user selects CAUI10 GTY default gui configuration with CMAC core selection as CMACE4_X0Y7
### and GT group X1Y48~X1Y57, the gt_ref_clk pin location is given below
### For other configuration / CMAC and GT locations, update the gt_ref_clk pin location accordingly
### and un-comment the below line
#set_property PACKAGE_PIN W9 [get_ports gt_ref_clk_p]



### Change these IO constraints as per your board and device
### For better placement, please LOC the IO's in the same GT SLR region

### Below IO Loc XDC constraints are for VCU118-REV-2.0 board 
### with xcvu9p-flga2104-2L-e device

### For init_clk input pin assignment, if single-ended clock is not available
### on the board, user has to instantiate IBUFDS in Example Design to convert 
### the differential clock to single-ended clock and make the necessary changes
